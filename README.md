## Abstract

To be added later.

## Analysis outputs

**The data required to run the scripts have not been included in the repo because study participants did not consent to public release of their data. However, the data are available on request from Peter Kamerman (peter.kamerman@gmail.com), or by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/kamermanpr/hivsn-incidence/issues).**

The outputs from all analysis scripts are located in the _/outputs_ directory. The outputs are formatted as markdown and html. The markdown documents are intermediate outputs generated during the production of the html documents, and while they allow quick browsing of the analysis outputs on GitHub, MathJax formulae and tables are not formatted.
